# The Data
Our data for measuring world happiness comes from United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network, in the form of their annual World Happiness Report , which is based on the happiness scores data from the Gallup World Poll. The scores range from 0 to 10,with 10 being the happiest and 0 being the unhappiest. These scores reflect a combination of current emotional reports and overall life evaluations. 

We also utilized shape files from [thethematicmapping.org](http://thematicmapping.org/downloads/world_borders.php).



# Happiness Score by Region

To further examine the change of happiness level numerically by each region of the world, this slope graph shows the average regional happiness scores and their changes from 2015 to 2017. The graph easily shows which region is the happiest place on earth compared to other regions in the world. 


```{r}
happy2015 <- read.csv("world-happiness-report/2015.csv")
happy2016 <- read.csv("world-happiness-report/2016.csv")
happy2017 <- read.csv("world-happiness-report/2017.csv")

happyRank2015region <- happy2015 %>% 
  select(Country, Happiness.Score, Region) %>% 
  rename( "HappinessScore2015" = "Happiness.Score") %>%
  group_by(Region) %>%
  summarize(avgHappinessScore = mean(HappinessScore2015)) %>%
  mutate(year = 2015)

happyRank2016region <- happy2016 %>% 
  select(Country, Happiness.Score, Region) %>% 
  rename( "HappinessScore2016" = "Happiness.Score") %>%
  group_by(Region) %>%
  summarize(avgHappinessScore = mean(HappinessScore2016)) %>%
  mutate(year = 2016)

regionHelp <- happy2015 %>% select(Country, Region)

happyRank2017regionold <- happy2017 %>% 
  select(Country, Happiness.Score)

happyRank2017region <- inner_join(happyRank2017regionold, regionHelp, by = "Country") %>%
  rename( "HappinessScore2017" = "Happiness.Score") %>%
  group_by(Region) %>%
  summarize(avgHappinessScore = mean(HappinessScore2017)) %>%
  mutate(year = 2017)


happySlope <- rbind(happyRank2015region,happyRank2016region,happyRank2017region) %>%
  mutate(avgHappinessScore = round(avgHappinessScore,4))

```

According to the slope graph, Australia and New Zealand, North America, Western Europe, and Latin America and Caribbean were the happiest regions in 2015, and remained the top four happiest regions. Southern Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa remained the two least happy regions, regardless of their score fluctuations. The happiness scores for Eastern Asia, Middle East and Northern Africa, Central and Eastern Europe, and Southeastern Asia were relatively close to each other from 2015 through 2017, despite Southeastern Asia surpassing Central and Eastern Europe as well as Middle East and Northern Africa with its slight growth in happiness score. 

Possible reasons for these rankings may come from the fact that Africa and Asia still suffer from a range of issues, including overpopulation, pandemics, emerging diseases, poverty, hunger, political oppressions, economic downturns and military conflicts. In contrast, the western hemisphere, which has benefited from years of capital accumulation and democratic progress, continues to thrive and keep its top spot for being the happiest place for people to live in.



# Shiny Application

Other than focusing on the final happiness scores, the World Happiness Report also provides the breakdown scores of five individual factors and Dystopia, which offers insights to the “truth” of happiness, specifically how the change in factors contribute to the change of the overall happiness score. To explore how these factors affect percent change in happiness, click on the picture below to access an interactive shiny application. You can switch between seven different scatterplots, which show the relationship between percent change in factor and percent change in happiness score from 2015 to 2017. These factors include: Economy, which represents the economic production in terms of GDP, Family, which stands for social support, Health, which is based on life expectancy, and Trust, which describes an absence of corruption. An additional variable that accounts for the happiness score is Dystopia, which is an imaginary country with the least happiest people. The variable offers a benchmark for all countries to be favorably compared in terms of positive values for the previous six key factors. It represents the amount of happiness score that can’t be described by the other factors.

Comparing the six scatter plots altogether, it appears that love is the most important factor for happiness because Family (social support) has the strongest positive correlation with the overall happiness score. The more social support people received, the happier they were. Freedom, Trust and Generosity also showed positive correlations with happiness as they commonly represent positive factors that fulfill people’s lives. However, the effect of Generosity may be confounded by an outlier. On the other hand, the scatter plots for Economy and Health displayed negative correlations, but note that, like Generosity, the relationship may be confounded by outliers. 


# Conclusion
Looking at all three visualizations, it appears that while there may have been large percent changes in happiness in some countries, happiness scores did not change much regionally between 2015 and 2017. In terms of factors that make up the happiness score, some can be informative, such as Family, Freedom and Trust, but many of the relationships between the factors and percent change in happiness score are strongly affected by outliers, making the apparent relationship unreliable.

Although the data provides a logical and consistent analysis on happiness, some critics have questioned the legitimacy of these standards because happiness is a subjective concept. One example that questions the legitimacy of these standards is the ranking of the Sub-Saharan African region, which has continuously been in the bottom. But do people who live there personally feel unhappy? Or are they unhappy by World Happiness standards? While this data does provide some insights into which parts of the world are the happier and why, it does leave some lingering questions, as the criteria was created by western standards that may not reflect happiness the same way that other cultures experience it.
